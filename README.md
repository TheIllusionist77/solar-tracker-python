# solar-tracker-python
Code for my solar tracking energy estimator, written in python and shell.

The files launcher.sh, main_controller.py, and PixelOperator.ttf are to be stored on the Raspberry Pi in a directory called SolarTracker under your home folder.

The processor.py file is solely for taking the raw text output of the main_controller.py file and make it readable using matplotlib and other methods.
